Graham defied the U. S. government to publish both the Pentagon Papers and the Watergate story, two of the century’s biggest scoops. During the decades she directed The Washington Post Company’s business, revenue grew by more than $1 billion and the stock price soared, solidifying Graham’s status as one of the country’s most savvy business leaders. In later life, she proved a talented storyteller in her own right, winning a Pulitzer Prize for her autobiographical narrative, “Personal History.”</p><p class="m-text__text">But until her mid-40s, Graham saw herself only as an obedient daughter and self-described “doormat wife,” with no real career prospects or sense of professional autonomy. That all changed when her husband, Philip Graham—president and former publisher of The Washington Post—killed himself, thrusting his wife into a role she never imagined she was qualified to hold.</p></article><p class="m-text__quote">“She was always recognized as an icon and a pioneer to women and journalists of my generation.”</p><span class="m-text__quote-author">— ALICIA SHEPARD, FORMER NPR OMBUDSMAN AND AUTHOR</span><article class="m-text__part-two"><p class="m-text__text">Surprising her male colleagues as well as herself, she embraced her new role long before “lean in” became a rallying cry for professional women. Her bold leadership of The Washington Post in the 1970s changed the course of American journalism, but like so many female leaders through history, she’s often been overlooked. She got only one mention in the film “All The President’s Men”—an otherwise detailed account of the Watergate scoop.</p><p class="m-text__text">“The Post” puts Graham back in the spotlight, reminding viewers of the impact female leaders can have when given the opportunity, said Alicia Shepard, former NPR ombudsman and author of “Woodward and Bernstein: Life in the Shadow of Watergate.”</p><p class="m-text__text">“She was always recognized as an icon and pioneer to women and journalists of my generation,” she said. “What she’s getting is second showing—a comeback act, if you will.”</p></article></section><section class="m-image-text"><picture><source media="(min-width:1024px)" srcset="images/graham.jpg"><img class="m-image-text__graham" src="images/graham_sm.jpg" alt="Katharine Graham" loading="lazy"></picture><span class="m-image-text__courtesy">(Courtesy of the Graham Family)</span><p class="m-image-text__heading">The “doormat wife”</p><article class="m-image-text__bio"><p class="m-image-text__text">Graham was born in 1917 to enormous wealth and privilege. Her multi-millionaire financier father purchased The Washington Post at a bankruptcy auction in 1933 and eventually appointed his son-in-law publisher, giving Phillip more shares of stock in the company than his daughter.</p><p class="m-image-text__text">Graham took it in stride. “As Dad explained to me, no man should be in the position of working for his wife,” she wrote in her memoir. “Curiously, I not only concurred but was in complete accord with this idea.” She often deferred to her husband, and she became a kind of second-class citizen in her marriage, Graham wrote, habitually putting Philip’s ambitions and desires above her own.</p><p class="m-image-text__text">“As he emerged more on the journalistic and political scenes, I increasingly saw my role as the tail to his kite—and the more I felt overshadowed, the more it became a reality,” Graham wrote.</p><p class="m-image-text__text">And then, after years of living with manic depression, Philip took his own life.</p></article></section><section class="m-slider"><div class="m-slider__header"><div class="m-slider__prostokat-1"></div><span class="m-slider__text-key">KEY EVENTS</span> <span class="m-slider__text-click">Click the arrows to view the timeline events.</span></div><div class="m-slider__arrows"><div class="m-slider__Prostokąt-2L" data-name="leftArrow"><div class="m-slider__Prostokąt-4"></div></div><div class="m-slider__Prostokąt-2R" data-name="rightArrow"><div class="m-slider__Prostokąt-3"></div></div></div><div class="m-slider__timeline"><div class="m-slider__Prostokąt-5" data-name="dateBg"></div><span class="m-slider__date-link" data-name="dateLink1">1917</span> <span class="m-slider__date-link" data-name="dateLink2">1940</span> <span class="m-slider__date-link" data-name="dateLink3">1963</span> <span class="m-slider__date-link" data-name="dateLink4">1971</span> <span class="m-slider__date-link" data-name="dateLink5">1974</span> <span class="m-slider__date-link" data-name="dateLink6">1997</span> <span class="m-slider__date-link" data-name="dateLink7">2001</span></div><div class="m-slider__bullets"><div class="m-slider__Elipsa-1" data-name="dot1"></div><div class="m-slider__Elipsa-1" data-name="dot2"></div><div class="m-slider__Elipsa-1" data-name="dot3"></div><div class="m-slider__Elipsa-1" data-name="dot4"></div><div class="m-slider__Elipsa-1" data-name="dot5"></div><div class="m-slider__Elipsa-1" data-name="dot6"></div><div class="m-slider__Elipsa-1" data-name="dot7"></div></div><div class="m-slider__item-01"><div class="m-slider__line"></div><span class="m-slider__info-item" data-name="infoItem"></span> <span class="m-slider__date-item" data-name="dateItem">1917</span><div class="m-slider__box" data-name="box"></div><div class="m-slider__slider-1" data-name="screen"><div class="m-slider__blind" data-name="screen-blind"></div></div><div class="m-slider__courtesy">(Courtesy of the Graham Family)</div></div></section><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__warstwa-3"></div><span class="footer__sources">Sources: Biography.com, “Personal History,” Neiman Reports, Pew, CNN, The New Yorker</span></footer><script src="js/main-c4bb6f7c1c7ed4c24f5e.js"></script></body></html>
